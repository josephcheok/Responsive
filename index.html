        I am a professional accountant by trade but an analytical problem solver
        at heart. That was the part of my work I really enjoyed. I had an opportunity 
        while I was an accountant at a power grid construction company to standardise the 
        reporting process for project engineers on Excel. I programmed some of the 
        repetitive steps project enginners performed to prepare their monthly reports 
        into push type button macros using Visual Basic, saving their time. Having very little
        background in programming, I bridged the knowledge gap to enable what I do through 
        YouTube and online forums. Once I have created an automated reporting template for the 
        engineers and my assignment was over, I was hungry for more!

        I also run a fully customisable apparel shop online called <a href="https://www.drawn2life.com.au"><img id="business-logo" src="assets/images/drawn2lifelogo.png"></a>.
        What we do is we allow the customer to draw up their own t-shirt, bag, tote or leggings using our 
        templates. We then get the customer to take a shot of the artwork on our template, I would
        then refine and digitise the artwork using Photoshop and Illustrator before transferring 
        the art over to fabric, which is then cut up and sewn to the customer's size and taste.
        I also had an opportunity to dwelve into website construction with the help of the tools 
        provided by Shopify. But there is a lot more things that I want to do on the website that go 
        beyond their basic tools!
